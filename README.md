I created a chloropleth map on the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree or higher in the Seattle area. I created a graph that changes based on the zoom and a neighborhood counter that tells you how many neighborhoods are within the zoom. I chose chloropleth because it was the right fit for visualizing the percentage of people within a certain area. A proportional symbol map would not be my first choice because percentages and proportional symbol maps are not the most compatible visually.
